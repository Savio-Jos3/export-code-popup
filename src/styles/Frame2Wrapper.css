/* --- CORRECTION FOR TAB CONTENT BACKGROUND --- */
/* The tab content (inner black frame) should follow the Segment Picker color only if 
   it's meant to be the *same* as the outer Frame 2, which is #00000066.
   However, the request says "same as the segment picker" (#FFFFFF14). 
   This means the content wrapper (TabContent) should NOT use the darker black (#1A1A1A) 
   we introduced previously. */

/* Let's adjust TabContent.css or TabContent.jsx to ensure the main .tab-content area uses the correct background.
   Since the Tab Content has its own inner wrapper (tab-content-container) we will remove the old
   inner black frame color and let the Frame 2 color bleed through, or explicitly set it 
   to the Segment Picker BG if it truly spans the entire inner frame. 
   
   Based on the visual, only the area around the tabs uses the Frame 2 BG. The content area is often transparent 
   or slightly different. Given the ambiguity, we'll assume the *whole* TabContent area inside Frame 2
   should use the `frame-2-bg` color, and the inner frame is the anomaly. We will revert the inner black frame 
   (tab-content-container) to transparent to see the main frame-2-bg. */
